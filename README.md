# Canvas Socket Hack

This is a quick hack to show off socket.io and canvas. It lets you
stream paths to all connected clients. It is not efficient. It is not
secure. It doesn't even save state!

# Usage

To run it, you will need [node.js][node] and [npmjs][npm]. Use `npm
install` to install the dependencies and then `node app.js` to run
it. Then point your favorite modern browser to your IP at port 3000.
